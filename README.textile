See the @.travis.yml@ file for details on the CI config used by Travis.

h1. Setup

Prerequisite: Java 8

@git clone https://github.com/hbz/nwbib.git ; cd nwbib@
@wget http://downloads.typesafe.com/typesafe-activator/1.2.10/typesafe-activator-1.2.10-minimal.zip@
@unzip typesafe-activator-1.2.10-minimal.zip@
@./activator-1.2.10-minimal/activator test@

h2. Eclipse setup

Replace @test@ with other Play commands, e.g. @"eclipse with-source=true"@ (generate Eclipse project config files, then import as existing project in Eclipse), @~ run@ (run in test mode, recompiles changed files on save, use this to keep your Eclipse project in sync while working, make sure to enable automatic workspace refresh in Eclipse).

h2. Production

Use @"start 8000"@ to run in production background mode on port 8000 (hit Ctrl+D to exit logs). To restart a production instance running in the background, you can use the included @restart.sh@ script (configured to use port 8000). For more information, see the "Play documentation":https://playframework.com/documentation/2.4.x/Home.
