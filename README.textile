h1. Build

"!https://secure.travis-ci.org/hbz/nwbib.png!":https://travis-ci.org/hbz/nwbib

See the @.travis.yml@ file for details on the CI config used by Travis.

h1. Setup

Prerequisite: Java 8

@git clone https://github.com/hbz/nwbib.git ; cd nwbib@
@wget http://downloads.typesafe.com/typesafe-activator/1.2.10/typesafe-activator-1.2.10-minimal.zip@
@unzip typesafe-activator-1.2.10-minimal.zip@
@./activator-1.2.10-minimal/activator test@

h2. Eclipse setup

Replace @test@ with other Play commands, e.g. @"eclipse with-source=true"@ (generate Eclipse project config files, then import as existing project in Eclipse), @~ run@ (run in test mode, recompiles changed files on save, use this to keep your Eclipse project in sync while working, make sure to enable automatic workspace refresh in Eclipse: @Preferences@ > @General@ > @Workspace@ > @Refresh using native hooks or polling@).

h2. Production

Use @"start 8000"@ to run in production background mode on port 8000 (hit Ctrl+D to exit logs). To restart a production instance running in the background, you can use the included @restart.sh@ script (configured to use port 8000). For more information, see the "Play documentation":https://playframework.com/documentation/2.4.x/Home.

h2. Classification

This application uses the classifications in "https://github.com/hbz/lobid-vocabs/tree/master/nwbib":https://github.com/hbz/lobid-vocabs/tree/master/nwbib. The @nwbib-spatial@ classification is based on Wikidata (see "http://slides.lobid.org/nwbib-wikidatacon/":http://slides.lobid.org/nwbib-wikidatacon/ for details). To update the local classification from Wikidata:

Delete the local Elasticsearch data:

@rm -rf ./data@

Delete the local Wikidata cache:

@rm conf/wikidata.json@

Re-generate the full classification:

@sbt "runMain SpatialToSkos"@

This creates a new @conf/nwbib-spatial.ttl@ file with data from the new @conf/wikidata.json@ and @conf/nwbib-spatial-conf.ttl@. The classification is consumed from "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hbz/lobid-vocabs/master/nwbib/nwbib-spatial.ttl":https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hbz/lobid-vocabs/master/nwbib/nwbib-spatial.ttl, so we copy the result to the @lobid-vocabs@ repo:

@cp conf/nwbib-spatial.ttl ../lobid-vocabs/nwbib/@

From here, we can diff, commit, and push our updated classification.
